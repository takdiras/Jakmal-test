# Jakmal-test
This is the finish project of Jakmall test by Takdir Saputro

# Using BEM Concept
I use Block, Element, and Modifier Concept for naming the class of the project

# Using Stylus
I use Stylus for css preprocessor and to implement BEM Concept easly using mixin

# Flexbox
I've been using display flexbox to create grid for a long time, because it easy to understand and easy to implment.

# Responsive VS Adaptive
I implement Responsive with percentage unit for width, min 320px and max 600px for mobile, and more than 600px for desktop view.
